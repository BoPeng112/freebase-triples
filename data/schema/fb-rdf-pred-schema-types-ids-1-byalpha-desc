Alternative titles, such as areographic coordinates on Mars, selenographic coordinates on the Moon, and heliographic coordinates on the Sun, are sometimes used to refer to the equivalent systems.For each planet, a system of longitude lines is set up by first defining a prime meridian to act as the origin of longitude. The prime meridian is an arbitrarily chosen meridian, typically passing through a prominent feature of the planet, such as a crater.  The other component of planetographic coordinates is latitude. Latitude lines are circles centered on the axis of a planet. The zero of latitude is at the equator, and 90 degrees is at the north pole. The north pole is distinguished from the south by the fact that when viewed from above, the planet's rotation is counterclockwise. In summary, planetographic coordinates are a system of coordinates created by the setting up of longitudinal and latitudinal lines on planets. A prime meridian is defined by the position of some prominent feature; positive longitude is in the direction of rotation, and positive latitude is in the direction of the north pole."@en	.

These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speed on parallel trajectories. Most are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all meteoroids disintegrate and never hit the earth's surface. Fragments which do contact Earth's surface are called meteorites. Because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths, and at the same velocity, they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky. This radiant point is caused by the effect of perspective, similar to railroad tracks converging at a single vanishing point on the horizon when viewed from the middle of the tracks. Meteor showers are almost always named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to originate."@en	.

While in space it is called a meteoroid. When it enters the atmosphere, air resistance causes the body to heat up and emit light, thus forming a fireball, also known as a meteor or shooting star. The term bolide\nrefers to either an extraterrestrial body that collides with the Earth,\nor to an exceptionally bright, fireball-like meteor regardless of\nwhether it ultimately impacts the surface.\nMeteorites have been found on the Moon and Mars.\nMeteorites that are recovered after being observed as they transited the atmosphere or impacted the Earth are called falls. All other meteorites are known as finds. As of mid-2006, there are approximately 1,050 witnessed falls having specimens in the world's collections. In contrast, there are over 31,000 well-documented meteorite finds.\nMeteorites are always named for the place where they were found,\nusually a nearby town or geographic feature. In cases where many\nmeteorites were found in one place, the name may be followed by a\nnumber or letter (e.g., Allan Hills 84001 or Dimmitt (b)).\nMeteorites have traditionally been divided into three broad\ncategories: stony meteorites are rocks, mainly composed of silicate\nminerals; iron meteorites\nare largely composed ofmetalliciron-nickel;and,stony-iron\nmeteorites contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material.\nModern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according\nto their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy.Source: Meteorite entry, Wikipedia"@en	.

No formal definition has been made for extrasolar planets.The term planet is an ancient one having ties to history, science, myth, and religion. The planets were originally seen as a divine presence; as emissaries of the gods. Even today, many people continue to believe the movement of the planets affects their lives, although such a causation is rejected by the scientific community. As scientific knowledge advanced, the human perception of the planets changed over time, incorporating a number of disparate objects. Even now there is no uncontested definition of what a planet is. In 2006, the IAU officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition has been both praised and criticized, and remains disputed by some scientists.The planets were initially thought to orbit the Earth in circular motions; after the development of the telescope, the planets were determined to orbit the Sun, and their orbits were found to be elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes and shared such features as ice-caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology. Since 1992, through the discovery of hundreds of extrasolar planets (planets around other stars), scientists are beginning to observe similar features throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and 277 known extrasolar ones. The Solar System also contains at least three dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto, and Eris). Many of these planets are orbited by one or more moons, which can be larger than small planets. Planets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density gas giants and smaller, rocky terrestrials."@en	.

Alternative titles, such as areographic coordinates on Mars, selenographic coordinates on the Moon, and heliographic coordinates on the Sun, are sometimes used to refer to the equivalent systems. The definition of planetographic coordinates requires a scheme for assigning longitude and latitude lines. For each planet, a system of longitude lines is set up by first defining a prime meridian to act as the origin of longitude.

By altering the production method (changes in time and temperature, for example) or the ingredients, a staggeringly wide variety of different types of beer can be produced.

E.g., if a person was a member of a committee for three legislative sessions, and the chair for a fourth, two separate memberships should be created.There is, perhaps, an apparent redundancy between the legislative session and start and end date properties. That is, since legislative sessions should also have their own start and end dates, either the session or dates served could be inferred. The start and end date properties allow for a great deal of precision, and may be particularly useful in cases where a person did not serve on a committee for the full session or if you want to compare total length of service.

</m.04l4q52>	</common.topic.description>	"A Noble person is an individual with state-privileged status who holds a title of nobility. The term originally referred to those who were \"known\" or \"notable\" and was applied to the highest social class in pre-modern societies. In the feudal system (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were generally those who held a fief, often land or office, under vassalage, i.e., in exchange for allegiance and various, mainly military, services to the Monarch and at lower levels to another nobleman. It rapidly came to be seen as a hereditary caste, sometimes associated with a right to bear a hereditary title and, for example in pre-revolutionary France, enjoying fiscal and other privileges. While noble status formerly conferred significant privileges, today, in most Western countries, noble status is a purely honorary dignity. In the United Kingdom, where some peerage titles, until recently, guaranteed a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament, there are still some residual privileges.Nobility is a historical, social and often legal notion, distinct from socio-economic status which is mainly based on income and possessions. Being wealthy or influential does not automatically make one a noble, nor are all nobles wealthy and influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the 'poor nobleman' is almost as old as nobility itself)."@en	.
