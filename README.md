#freebase-triples

A repository to document the effort to clean and analyze the Freebase data dumps.

## Freebase

The [Freebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebase) Wikipedia article provides a good overview of the knowledge base's nearly decade-long lifetime from its beginnings at Metaweb Technologies, Inc. in 2007, its acquisition by Google in 2010, and its eventual shutdown and move to Wikidata towards 2015-2016. Freebase accepted queries to its vast stores of data through the Metaweb Query Language (MQL).

Although the shutdown of freebase.com was set for as early as June 30, 2015 according to this [Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/u/0/109936836907132434202/posts/bu3z2wVqcQc), the actual website could be accessed for quite a long time. On May 2, 2016, freebase.com was finally closed off as announced in this [Google Group post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/freebase-discuss/WEnyO8f7xOQ). The link now redirects to the static Freebase data dumps.

## Freebase Data Dumps

A data dump of 1.9 billion Freebase Triples in [N-Triples RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples) format is available on the [developers page](https://developers.google.com/freebase/#freebase-rdf-dumps) under the [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/) license. The [freebase.com](http://freebase.com) URL also redirects to this page following its shutdown. 
The file is listed as being 22 GB gzip compressed and 250 GB uncompressed according to the website, although recent downloads exceed this file size (a May 2016 download amounted to >30 GB compressed and >400 GB uncompressed). 

Examining the compressed data with Z commands on the terminal:

```
$ # Scan through the data with zmore or zless
$ zmore freebase-rdf-latest.gz

```

Each triple is encoded in the aforementioned N-Triples format. The subject, predicate, and object values on each line are "< >" enclosed and tab separated. Each line terminates with a "." and is newline separated. 

Viewing this with `vim`, using `:set list`:

```
</american_football.football_player.footballdb_id>^I</type.object.name>^I"footballdb ID"@en^I.$                                       
</astronomy.astronomical_observatory.discoveries>^I</type.object.name>^I"Discoveries"@en^I.$
</automotive.body_style.fuel_tank_capacity>^I</type.object.name>^I"Fuel Tank Capacity"@en^I.$
</automotive.engine.engine_type>^I</type.object.name>^I"Engine Type"@en^I.$
</automotive.trim_level.max_passengers>^I</type.object.name>^I"Maximum Number of Passengers"@en^I.$

```


## Scripts

The scripts in this repo are mostly written in Bash and Python. Bash/Shell scripts handle the initial parsing for the massive data files. Python, with its many libraries, is a simple way to use the triples data after some initial processing.


## ETL Changes

This section tracks the changes made to the raw triples data dump to ease processing of the data. [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) refers to the extraction, transformation, and loading of large datasets. 

The data dumps encode Freebase data in a few ways that are different from the usual usage on Freebase.com. 

- Notes
    - "/" is replaced by "." for topic mids and domains/types/properties.
    - URLs to freebase.com or w3.org are used, not just the Freebase mids. All freebase.com addresses no longer work following the site shutdown but remain in the data dump as unique identifiers.
    - A mix of freebase.com and w3.org schemas are used, especially as predicates in the triples.
    - There are over 1.9 billion triples and thus the same amount of lines in the entire data dump.
    - The triples are already sorted alphabetically in some columns. 


- Tasks:
    1. Simplifying Data
        - Convert N-Triples [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples) format to N3 [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3) or other format. Working with the full URIs conforms to the standard, but can be unwieldy to use. Removing "http://rdf.freebase.com/*", "http://www.w3.org/*" with Regular Expressions.
            - Running on a head sample of 10k triples shows the following diffs in file size. The file size reduction where ~43% of the original is preserved looks promising.
            ```
            # Test Files:
            Original:   fb-triples-10k-head.nt - 1368687 bytes
            c1:         fb-triples-10k-head-c1.nt - 589935 bytes (43.1%)
            c2:         fb-triples-10k-head-c2.nt - 589111 bytes (43.0%)
            ```
            - Adding pv to display a progress bar.
            ```
            $ bash parse-triples-pv.sh
            xxB 0:00:00 [xx.xMiB/s] [>                                                            ]  0% ETA 0:00:00
            ```
            - Running on the entire data dump (>5 hrs locally). ~53% of the original is kept after the first pass:
            ```
            # Entire File:
            Original:   freebase-rdf-latest - 425229008315 bytes
            c1:         freebase-rdf-latest-c1 - 229008851191 bytes (53.8%)
            ```
        - Optional: Convert "." back to "/" in the domain, type, and property schemas to return a more Freebase-like format (e.g. /award/award_winner for types).
        - Optional: Removing "< >" format which encloses each value.
        - ...
    2. Indexing/Sorting Data
        - Using `awk` to parse data.
        - Dataset for quick topic lookups - extract triples with predicate == /type.object.name, /common.topic.description and possibly /type.object.type. Scripts should create separate data sets for each.
            - Distinguish textual type values (name, description) by ISO language codes
            - Process further for Freebase user-created /base domain, types, and properties. Easily distinguishable as these take the form /user/...
        - Dataset for schema - extract triples with predicate == /type.property.schema; predicate == /type.object.type and object == /type.property; (many others...)
        - i18n Support - Text values are associated with an ISO language code (e.g. "String value"@en )
        - ...
    3. Interpreting Data
        - [Cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley) - Try the Cayley graph database
        - [Gephi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gephi) - Try Gephi open-source software
        - [Neo4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j) - Try the Neo4j graph database


## Analysis

Once the data is cleaned and ready, this section outlines some of the software to manipluate, visualize, and analyze it.

### Cayley

The Cayley graph database and platform can be used to analyze the cleaned triples data. Cayley is an open-source graph database that draws on Freebase and the Knowledge Graph. It is maintained by a Google employee, with the GitHub repository at [cayleygraph/cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley).

A Gremlin query using the Cayley Visualize function in the browser.

```
$ # On the command line:
$ ./cayley http --dbpath=data/testdata.nq

> // Running Cayley in the browser locally
> // Visualizing instances of /award/award_winner
> // Set GetLimit() as getting All() creates a large cluster of thousands of nodes
> g.V("/award.award_winner").Tag("source").Out("/type.type.instance").Tag("target").GetLimit(10)

```
